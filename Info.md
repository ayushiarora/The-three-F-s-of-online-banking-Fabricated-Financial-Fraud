Synthetic Financial Fraud Detection Using R

### Anomaly Detection for Fraudulent Transactions

Paysim synthetic dataset of mobile money transactions. Each step represents an hour of simulation. This dataset is scaled down 1/4 of the original dataset which is presented in the paper "PaySim: A financial mobile money simulator for fraud detection".
We present a synthetic dataset generated using the simulator called PaySim as an approach to such a problem. PaySim uses aggregated data from the private dataset to generate a synthetic dataset that resembles the normal operation of transactions and injects malicious behaviour to later evaluate the performance of fraud detection methods.

### DATASET DICTIONARY

#### The Dimensions of the Data Set are : "1010 Rows and 151 Columns".

### PROBLEM STATEMENT
#### Analyzing the role of gender in various creative activities such as music, hobbies etc by using surveyed data of over an year
